    <div class="project-description">
      I am currently developing an aggregator tool for non-coding variant interpretation.
      It integrates multiple scoring algorithms (many optimized for hg38) and accounts for
      tissue-specific gene expression. The system combines these predictive metrics to
      estimate variant deleteriousness with improved biological context.

    <div class="project-duration">Feb – Jul 2024</div>
    <div class="project-description">
      Publicly available GEO methylation array datasets from prostate cancer patients were
      analyzed to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs). I identified five genes
      showing consistent methylation differences, validated using TCGA pan-cancer data.
      These DMRs may represent potential prostate-specific biomarkers.
