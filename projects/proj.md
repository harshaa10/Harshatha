Non-coding Variant Interpretation: An aggregator tool for deleteriousness scoring
Ongoing

I am currently developing an aggregator tool for non-coding variant interpretation.
There are multiple scoring algorithms for scoring the variants and only a few of those are available for hg38 human genome. This tool also considers the tissue specificity of the variant based on the gene expression analysis. This scoring system considers all the underlying factors in combination with the predictions by investigator tools and scores a variant, giving information about its deleteriousness.


DNA methylation analysis of prostate cancer to identify potential biomarkers
Feb-Jul 2024

I used publically available GEO methylation array datasets from prostate cancer patients and analyzed differentially methylated regions (DMRs) using python packages. I identified 5 unique genes which are differentially methylated in prostate cancer and validated this using the TCGA pan-cancer cohort. These DMRs can be potential prostate specific biomarkers, provided they analyzed in a larger cohort and are functionally validated.
