I am Harshatha, a Bioinformatician by day and a curious girl by night.
I enjoy analysing biological data, exploring patterns, infering the trends, simulating, digging around to find something odd, something same, and all things different.
I have just started my journey in this exponentially growing field and I am looking forward to learnig new things, contribute my part to the amazing work being done.
